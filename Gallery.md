## Gallery of interactive ClimateMARGO.jl applications

- **The [Official ClimateMARGO web-app](https://margo.plutojl.org/introduction.html)**, currently hosted by our collaborators at [`Pluto.jl`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).


#### Other platforms for interactively using ClimateMARGO.jl (possibly deprecated)
- [ClimateMARGO demo via Observable](https://observablehq.com/@margo/visualizations) (official release coming *soon*). Interactive climate change articles with a Javascript frontend hosted by [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), and a privately hosted web server running ClimateMARGO.jl in the backend.

- [ClimateWidgets](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateWidgets) dashboard via Binder [[click here to launch]](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ClimateMARGO/ClimateWidgets/main?urlpath=pluto/open?path=MARGO_optimization_dashboard.jl). This is an *interactive*– and *reactive*– Pluto.jl notebook that allows real-time manuplation of the ClimateMARGO.jl model, generously hosted by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). The page may take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to load– we are working on decreasing the spin-up time!
