## Gallery of interactive ClimateMARGO.jl applications

- *Coming soon*: Interactive climate change articles with a Javascript frontend hosted by [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), and a privately hosted web server running ClimateMARGO.jl in the backend.

- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ClimateMARGO/ClimateWidgets/master?urlpath=pluto/open?path=MARGO_optimization_dashboard.jl) The [ClimateWidgets](https://github.com/ClimateMARGO/ClimateWidgets) interactive dashboard. This is an *interactive*– and *reactive*– Pluto.jl notebook that allows real-time manuplation of the ClimateMARGO.jl model, generously hosted by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). The page may take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to load– we are working on decreasing the spin-up time!
