Our design philosophy is for the MARGO model to be as simple as possible while still producing quasi-realistic climate trajectories over the next few hundred years.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Compared to more conventional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), MARGO is:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Faster: The algorithm solves convex optimization problems in less than 10 milliseconds (most use cases), meaning the model can be run interactively in real-time and that both large-ensemble, high-dimensional, and stochastic optimizations are all computationally feasible.\nMore accessible: The ClimateMARGO.jl package is free to use and is accessible in several different forms depending on the user's programming experience and use case:\nAn interactive web-app (Coming Soon) – For code-free interactive exploration of climate storylines (and their sensitivity to model parameters)\nA browser-based binder tutorial – For users with some programming experience who want to see (and run!) the ClimateMARGO.jl source code\nImporting ClimateMARGO.jl – For users proficient in Julia who want to use the MARGO model for education or scientific research\nForking ClimateMARGO.jl – For users wanting to extend or fundamentally modify the MARGO model for scientific research\nMore interpretable: The entire model algorithm is simple enough to be expressed in a single closed-form math equation and is determined by only a handful of intuitive free parameters (see also the MARGO flowchart below).\nMore transparent: The MARGO model is developed as an entirely open-source Julia package, ClimateMARGO.jl, complete with documentation, in-depth tutorials, and publication-quality example simulations.\nMore general: By including all four of the primary climate controls in the default configuration, more common configurations like \"Mitigation-only\" experiments are straight-forward to implement by simply turning unwanted features off. \nMore explicitly value-dependent: Rather than burying important value-dependent choices in various obscure economic and social parameters, we abstract away many of the complexities to yield a small number of intuitive parameters, which can be easily modified by users.\nMore extendable: The modular and interpretable nature of the Julia source implementation means that existing features can be easily modified and new features are easily added.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":":warning: The extreme simplicity of the MARGO model also means its quantitative results should be taken with a large pinch of salt.
