href="#The-causal-chain-of-climate-suffering" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>It is helpful to conceptualize climate change as a four step process that connects the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the eventual climate suffering (or damages) that they cause. This four-step framing reflects the four major human controls (or controls) which can sever these links to reduce climate suffering: <strong>M</strong>itigation of GHG emissions (e.g. switching away from fossil fuels), <strong>R</strong>emoval of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g. by planting trees or storing biofuel emissions underground), <strong>G</strong>eoengineering by solar radiation management (e.g. injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reduce incoming sunlight), or <strong>A</strong>dapting to the changed climate (e.g. relocating coastal communities displaced by rising seas or expanding indoor air condititiong to fight off intensifying heat waves).</p><div>\[\text{Emissions}\,

MARGO empowers users to explore the trade-offs between climate controls and climate suffering by employing an optimization framework commonly used in the climate-economics community. In this section, we develop a simple theory– a set of mathematical equations– which capture the key aspects of the entire causal chain of climate damages.</p><p><img src="../MARGO_schematic.png" alt="MARGO schematic"/></p><div class="admonition is-category-ukw"><header class="admonition-header">Tuning MARGO&#39;s free parameters</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>We have attempted to make reasonable choices for the default values of MARGO&#39;s parameters in the equations below.

For example, the full set of control variables in MARGO is <span>$\{M(t), R(t), G(t), A(t)\}$</span> (with <span>$N$</span> timesteps in time). An <em>objective function</em> is any scalar-valued function of the control variables, meaning it only produces a single value (as opposed to a multi-valued vector). Optimizing MARGO largely consists of defining the objective function to optimize. For example, one might aim to minimize the total costs of climate controls.</p><p>An optimization problem can further be customized by added constraints on valid sets of the control variables. For example, in MARGO we impose the constraints <span>$0\% &lt; M(t) &lt; 100\%$</span> because it does not make any sense to mitigate emissions less than 0\% or more than 100\% (carbon dioxide removal is treated separately by the <span>$R(t)$</span> control variable). Similarly, we rule out any combination of control variables that produces unphysical outcomes like negative CO<span>$_{2e}$</span> concentrations.</p><p>Constraints can often be used to add meaning to an otherwise meaningless optimization problem. Consider the example above of minimizing the net costs of climate controls. Without any additional constraints, the solution to the problem is... to do nothing. Zero climate controls costs zero dollars. Suppose we now add in a constraint that the temperature change relative to pre-industrial must not exceed 2°C. While doing nothing still carries no climate control costs, it is no longer a solution to the problem since the resulting warming will overshoot the constraint by several degrees celsius.
