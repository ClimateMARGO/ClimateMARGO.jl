# MARGO.jl: an idealized framework for optimal deployments of climate control strategies

The MARGO model is described in an accompanying (not yet peer-reviewed) manuscript, available to all at [EarthArXiv.org/5bgyc](https://eartharxiv.org/5bgyc/).

Try out the MARGO model by running through this Binder tutorial right in your browser (you don't need to download anything â€“ just click the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hdrake/MARGO. jl/master?filepath=examples%2Ftutorials%2Fbasic_tutorial.ipynb) button and, once the tutorial loads, click on the code cells and press ``Enter`` to run them).


MARGO is currently undocumented and still in alpha testing. Anyone interested in helping develop the model should contact post an Issue here or contact Henri Drake directly (henrifdrake `at` gmail.com), until explicit guidelines for contributing to the model are posted at a later date.
