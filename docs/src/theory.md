## The Causal Chain of Climate Damages

It is helpful to conceptualize climate change as a four step process that connects the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the eventual climate suffering (or damages) that they cause. This four-step framing is helpful because it highlights the four major human interventions (or controls) which can break these links and reduce climate suffering: *M*itigation of GHG emissions (e.g. switching away from fossil fuels), *R*emoval of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g. by planting trees or storing biofuel emissions underground), *G*eoengineering by solar radiation management (e.g. injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reduce incoming sunlight), or *A*dapting to the changed climate (e.g. relocating coastal communities displaced by rising seas or expanding indoor air condititiong to fight off intensifying heat waves).

```math
\text{Emissions}
\xrightarrow{\text{\textbf{M}}}
\text{GHGs}
\xrightarrow{\text{\textbf{R}}}
\text{Forcing}
\xrightarrow{\text{\textbf{G}}}
\text{Warming}
\xrightarrow{\text{\textbf{A}}}
\text{Damages}.
\label{eq:causal-chain}
```

Letting climate change run rampant would cause a lot of damage; however, climate interventions that keep climate change under control are not free either. With MARGO, we allow users to explore the trade-offs between climate interventions and climate suffering by employing an optimization framework commonly used in the climate-economics community. In this section, we develop a simple theory– a set of mathematical equations– which capture the key aspects of the entire causal chain of climate damages.

## GHG Emissions (and emissions mitigation)

## GHG Concentrations (and carbon dioxide removal)

## Radiative forcing (and solar radiation management)

## Global warming and climate suffering (and adaptation)

## The costs of climate intervention
